ECE 325 Lab Assignment 5: Computing the salaries of
band members
(10 points total) Your band is finally earning some money! Not a lot, but you feel it is time to automate
the computation of the salaries of the band members. You started to implement a static method to
compute the salary (see Salary.java), but the other band members complained that it is very buggy. One
even implied that it was not tested at all (how dare they). In this assignment, you need to improve the
implementation of the pay() method, and, given the importance of the correctness of this method,
provide a test suite for the method to make sure that you are not incorrectly paying the band members.
The method has three parameters:
• salary: The base salary earned by a band member during a salary period (in dollars).
• snacksAmount: The total amount spent by a band member on snacks during tours and shows
during a salary period (in dollars).
• bonus: The bonus percentage that the member earned this salary period (in percentage).
The pay is computed by deducting the amount spent on snacks from the base salary, and then
computing and adding the bonus (if any) over that amount. So, if a band member earned 100 dollars,
spent 50 on snacks, and earned a bonus of 10 (%), their pay will be 55 dollars.
The pay parameters have the following properties (aside from ‘common sense’ properties, which you
should figure out yourself):
• The base salary can be maximum $1,000.
• The bonus can be between 0 and 10 (%).
• A band member cannot spend more on snacks than their base salary.
• Because of a strange compatibility issue with your accountant’s software, the salary and
snacksAmount are both Double objects, and the bonus is specified as an Integer object. The pay
method must return a Double object. You cannot change this as your accountant will get mad.
For this assignment, you need to:
1) Improve the pay() method given the above requirements.
2) Create a test plan to test the pay() method. The test plan consists of a table with the parameter values
and the expected output of the method. Also, please indicate in which test method you cover the case.
3) Implement your test plan as JUnit test class TestSalary. Make sure to give your test cases descriptive
names, to make it easier to debug your code if a test fails.
Please do not modify any of the names/methods we’ve defined in the provided *.java files. You
will get 0 points for this assignment if you do.
Hints:
• Because you’re doing computations with Doubles (i.e., you’re doing floating point arithmetic),
there will be some precision errors. JUnit allows you to specify a delta to verify whether the
result is within a certain error range
(https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.0.1/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/Assertions.html#assertEquals-
double-double-double-). For this assignment, you can set delta to 0.001.
• For invalid results, your pay() method should throw an IllegalArgumentException. Make sure to
include a message that explains why the exception is thrown (you can decide exactly which
message).
• You are not allowed to change the signature of the pay() method. If you do, you will get 0
points for this assignment.
Rubric
(20 points total)
(16 points) Correct implementation of pay() method. Your pay() method will be tested using our
extensive JUnit test suite.
(4 points) Test plan
If you do not submit a test plan and/or test suite, or they do not make sense or do not match your
implementation, we can deduct more points.
Please submit:
1) A zip file containing your improved Salary class, your test suite and a PDF with your test plan.
Name the file ‘FirstName_ID_asg5.zip’ and keep the exact same file structure as the zip that was
provided for the assignment. You can store the test file in the same location as the Salary class. For
example,

2) A screencast/movie that shows the following steps:
• Open your eClass with your name shown
• Open your IDE
• Show your code briefly
• Execute your test suite and show that all tests pass.
Please do not modify any of the names/methods we’ve defined in the provided *.java files.












1. **Correct Salary Calculation**:
   - **Purpose**: Evaluate if the `pay` method accurately computes the take-home salary given a range of valid inputs. This includes base salary, snacks expenses, and bonus percentages adhering to defined constraints.
   - **Details**: Tests are crafted to cover typical use cases, ensuring that the deduction of snack expenses and the computation of bonuses are accurately reflected in the final pay. Specific focus is given to edge scenarios such as having zero bonuses or a maximum base salary of $1000.
   - **Example Case**: With inputs of a $100 base salary, $50 spent on snacks, and a 10% bonus, the expected pay output should be $55. This confirms that the method correctly calculates deductions and applies the percentage bonus.

2. **Illegal Argument Handling**:
   - **Purpose**: Ensure that the method robustly handles inputs failing to meet stipulated constraints by throwing an `IllegalArgumentException`.
   - **Details**: The suite tests scenarios including salaries exceeding $1000, any form of negative input values, and snack expenses surpassing the salary. These tests validate that the method’s parameter validations are preventing unrealistic or illegal situations.
   - **Example Case**: Inputting a salary of $1200 ought to trigger an exception as this exceeds the maximum allowable salary according to the requirements.

3. **Null Input Handling**:
   - **Purpose**: Validate that the method appropriately addresses cases where `null` values are input by throwing a `NullPointerException`, thereby preventing unintended behaviors or system crashes.
   - **Details**: Each parameter is separately tested with `null` to ensure thorough coverage and reliable error messaging whenever null inputs compromise expected operations.
   - **Example Case**: Invoking the method with `pay(null, 50.0, 5)` is expected to produce a `NullPointerException`, indicating that the method cannot proceed with inadequate information.

4. **Input Type Validation**:
   - **Purpose**: Ascertain that only valid data types, precisely Java objects as specified (i.e., `Double` and `Integer`), are accepted by the method, rejecting incompatible types through typical parsing failures.
   - **Details**: Tests involve attempting to parse non-numeric strings as salary, snack amounts, and bonuses to verify enforcement of correct data formats and types.
   - **Example Case**: Attempting to parse `pay("abc", "50.0", "5")` should culminate in a `NumberFormatException`, indicating a failure in data conversion due to incorrect format.

5. **Boundary and Edge Cases**:
   - **Purpose**: Confirm that the method reliably executes under boundary conditions, embodying values at the permissible extremes as well as zero-value scenarios.
   - **Details**: Tests are deployed with minimum non-negative values, zero expenses, and maximum bonus percentages to ensure the method's robustness and accuracy extending to its operational envelope.
   - **Example Case**: Providing both salary and snacks as $0 should naturally yield a pay of $0, validating the method's logic in scenarios of no economic exchange.

#### Tools and Framework:

- **JUnit**: Employing JUnit allows for high precision in assertions such as `assertEquals` with a delta of 0.001, governing acceptable floating-point discrepancies. This offers structured and automated testing of method functionality as well as exception handling.

---

### Conclusion:

This comprehensive test plan is structured to rigorously verify both the functional accuracy and the reliability of the `pay` method across a spectrum of logical, operational, and erroneous conditions. It ensures that user constraints are adhered to and that the framework graciously responds to invalid input scenarios, fulfilling the assignment's requirement for an infallible salary computation tool.
